    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips loose.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips squeezed tighter like a trumpet player.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Your voice makes sounds at many different pitches or frequencies.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Put a rubber band around your fingers and pluck the rubber band.\n",

    "<p>When something is tighter, it will usually be a higher frequency.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "Audacity can show the sound like:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"../docs/sound/laughScreenCast.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The highlighted area has peaks that are wider so the peaks are not happening as often meaning they are slower. A slower vibration means a lower pitch, so this part of the sound is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The height (both higher and lower) of the peak means how how loud the sound is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Audacity, you can experiment with sounds in the Generate menu. Examples are Generate/Chirp or Generate/Tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a small part of the sound and use View/Zoom to select to see what form of wave there is. A wave is the ripples like on a lake or the ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting point is that a sine wave is a single frequency, and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave\">square wave</a> is sine waves at all frequencies added together."
