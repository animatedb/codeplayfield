jupyter problems

- The user interface is difficult for kids. How will they know "Restart the kernal"?
  Then the thing where there are modes for fields, etc. Could be confusing.
  There really needs to be a better editor.
  I think there is a way to add buttons to markup, but it is not intrinsic in
  Jupyter.

- For kids, should have an easy way to select modifications to the code.
  This may be possible in Jupyter, but I don't know yet. Looks like there
  probably is using ipywidgets.

- loading a python file to edit loads it once, then doesn't update if the
  code on disk is modified.

- No way to embed a video cleanly. This requires running code. Browsers
  allow right click on video to play.

- Would be nice if it ran the static checker mypy.

- Hyperlinks with url and section don't work in jupyter lab, but do work in jupyter-notebook.
  They don't use the same code base?

- It is possible to use the markdown or the html img or div tags, but none of these
  allow setting width independent of height.
  This is in every exported html.
	.jp-RenderedHTMLCommon img,
	.jp-RenderedImage img,
	.jp-RenderedHTMLCommon svg,
	.jp-RenderedSVG svg {
	  max-width: 100%;
	  height: auto;
	}

  Solution (use !important):
	<img src="../docs/images/1-pets.jpg" style="width:100px !important;height:400px;" />

- Markdown is limited. Using a list with '*' does not allow html in the list
  element for example if you wanted to set image width and height, or an html
  reference with an url and section. It is easier to just use <ul><li>...

- Editor - sometimes shift delete doesn't work? Ctrl-X always seems to work.


# Install ipywidgets using pip
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install ipywidgets

import ipywidgets as ipw
ipw.IntSlider()
