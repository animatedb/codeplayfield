<h1>Inkscape</h1>
<p>
Inkscape allows editing vector based drawings. Vector based means that everything is drawn using
lines. Shapes are drawn by lines, and can be filled with colors.
</p>
An example of vector based image is:
<br><img src="images/2-fish-1.png" width="200"><br>
Another example is:
<br><img src="images/Loop.svg" width="200"><br>


<h2><a name="installinkscape">Install Inkscape</a></h2>
For Windows:<br/>
<a href="https://inkscape.org/release">https://inkscape.org/release</a>
<p>
For Ubuntu:<br/>
Install Inkscape using Synaptic or command line.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>
  sudo install inkscape
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="editvectorimage">Edit Vector Image</a></h2>
<p>
Install <a href="#installinkscape">Inkscape</a> using Synaptic or command line.<br/>
</p><p>
Use File/New to create a new drawing. Inkscape is used to edit vector images (such as .svg)
or shapes and text.
</p>


<h2>Free drawing (without a grid)</h2>
<p>
The left hand side shows the icons for choosing a tool.
</p>
Most important tools:
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Pointer</td><td>Click mouse button to select lines, shape or text. Press mouse
button, move mouse and release to select an area around objects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Point Pointer</td><td>Move points of shapes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rectangle</td><td>Press mouse button, move mouse and release to draw a rectangle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Circle</td><td>Press mouse button, move mouse and release to draw a rectangle.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pencil</td><td>Click mouse button at two different points to draw a line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>Draw some text</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Clicking on a shape allows moving the shape or changing the size.
When a shape is selected, the Fill and Stroke window can be used to set colors, and
add arrows to lines or to draw lines with dashes.
</p>
<p>
The shift key can be held down to select multiple shapes. Then colors can be changed for many shapes at a time.
</p>
<p>When a new drawing is created, a rectangle is drawn on the screen that shows the
size of the image that will be saved. To change the size of the drawing, use the menu
File/Document Properties and click on "Resize page to content...". Then
click on "Resize page to drawing or selection".</p>


<h2>Drawing with a grid</h2>
Drawing with a grid allows making drawings where things are aligned to each other
and have even spacing.
<p>
It is possible to align things without a grid using the "Align and Distribute" icon
and window. The icon is near the top right icons. It allows aligning many selected
objects to some place.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on the grid.
<li>Select the menu File/Document Properties.</li>
<li>Click on "Grids"</li>
<li>Click "New"</li>
<li>Close the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Inkscape is a little strange that the grid changes depending on the zoom. The zoom
can be changed using "Shift +" and "Shift -". It is better to zoom in when drawing
smaller shapes.
</p>
<p>
The icons that control the snapping between shapes or to the grid are on the
right side of the screen. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it is difficult to snap something like text to the grid. It helps to
turn off the bounding box snap and leave the text snap on. So get used to changing
snap icons often.
</p>

The common things that can be snapped are:
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Bounding boxes</td><td>Snap to corners or edges</td></tr>
<tr><td>Paths and nodes</td><td>Nodes are points that define paths.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Text</td><td>The base line of the text.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grid</td><td>Snap between other things above and the grid.</td></tr>
</table>
draw to grid
	- use icons on right side of drawing
		- "A" icon sets whether to use text anchor
		- top icons choose which part of bounding rect to snap to grid

when done
	- File/Document Properties
	- Resize page to drawing or selection


<h2>Draw Sine Wave (3 sines)</h2>
Complex shapes can be generated using the menu Extensions/Render.
For example, to draw a sine wave, select Extensions/Render/FunctionPlotter
and enter the following parameters:
<pre>
	Start X = 0
	End X = 3
	Y value of rect bottom = 0
	Y value of rect top = 1
	Number of samples = 17
	Uncheck everything except
		Check Multiple X range by 2*pi
		Calculate first derivative numerically
	Function = sin(x)
	First derivative = x
</pre>

<h2>Draw Clock</h2>
This explains how to draw tic marks around a circle.

Draw the outside of the clock.
<ul>
<li>Draw circle, set size 100x100 and position x=50,y=150</li>
<li>Copy circle, set size 96x96 and position x=52, y=152</li>
</ul>

Make tick marks
<ul>
<li>Click align and distribute icon (three bars) at top right icons</li>
<li>Make a rectangule to use as the tic mark</li>
<li>Select the smaller circle and shift click and select marker</li>
<li>In Align and Distribute</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Click center icon in Align section</li>
  <li>Click align top icon</li>
  </ul>
<li>Click on snap icons at right of screen and turn on all snap icons</li>
<li>Click on top ruler and drag and drop into center of circle</li>
<li>Do the same for the left ruler</li>
<li>Select marker click on it until + appears in the middle</li>
<li>Drag the plus out of the rectangle and to center of circle</li>
<li>Select the menu Edit/Clone/Create Tiled Clones
  <pre>
	Shift: Shift X=0
	Shift: Shift Y=-100
	Rotation: Angle=6
	Rotation: Rows,columns=60x1
  </pre>
  </li>
<li>Make a clock hand</li>
<ul>
  <li>Click at a point at one end, view the coordinates at some point along the line</li>
  <li>Make a line to the desired coordinates.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
