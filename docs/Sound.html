<title>Sound</title>


<h2 id="Sound-Frequency">Sound Frequency<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sound-Frequency"></a></h2><p>Sound is made by air being squeezed many times very quickly. It usually gets squeezed by things that vibrate very quickly.</p>
<p></p>
Some examples are:
<ul>
    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips loose.</li>
    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips squeezed tighter like a trumpet player.</li>
    <li>Your voice makes sounds at many different pitches or frequencies.</li>
    <li>Put a rubber band around your fingers and pluck the rubber band.
    Change how tight the rubber band is, and pluck it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When something is vibrating slowly, it makes a low sound, and when vibrating fast, makes a higher sound. When it is slow, it is less frequent, and when fast, it is a higher "frequency".</p><p>When something is tighter, it will usually be a higher frequency.</p><p>Sound is indicated by the number of times it changes per second.
You can hear things as low as about 20 times per second. A voice could
be 300 to 3000 times per second. The highest pitches you can hear are
around 20000 times per second.

<h2 id="Viewing-Sound">Viewing Sound<a class="anchor-link" href="#Viewing-Sound"></a></h2><p>There are programs that can <a href="../docs/Tasks.html#editsound">edit sound</a>.</p>
<p>Audacity can show the sound like:<br>
<img src="../docs/sound/laughScreenCast.png"></p>
<p>The highlighted area has peaks that are wider so the peaks are not happening as often meaning they are slower. A slower vibration means a lower pitch, so this part of the sound is lower.</p>
<p>The height (both higher and lower) of the peak means how how loud the sound is.</p>
<p>In Audacity, you can experiment with sounds in the Generate menu. Examples are Generate/Chirp or Generate/Tone.</p>
<p>Select a small part of the sound and use View/Zoom to select to see what form of wave there is. A wave is the ripples like on a lake or the ocean.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that a sine wave is a single frequency, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a> is sine waves at all frequencies added together.</p>
