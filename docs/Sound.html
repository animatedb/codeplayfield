<h2 id="Sound-Frequency">Sound Frequency<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sound-Frequency"></a></h2><p>Sound is made by air being squeezed many times very quickly usually by things that move back and forth often.</p>
<p></p>
Some examples are:
<ul>
    <li>Blow through your lips while they are loose.</li>
    <li>Blow through your lips with them squeezed tighter as a trumpet player.</li>
    <li>Your voice makes sounds at many different pitches.</li>
    <li>Put a rubber band around your fingers and pluck the rubber band.
    Change how tight the rubber band is, and pluck it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When something is moving back and forth slowly, it makes a low tone, and when it is fast, makes a higher tone.</p><p>When something is tighter, it will usually make a higher tone.</p><p>The tone is measured by the number of times it changes per second.
You can hear things as low as about 20 times per second. A voice is usually
between 300 to 3000 times per second. The highest pitches you can hear are
around 20000 times per second.

<h2 id="Viewing-Sound">Viewing Sound<a class="anchor-link" href="#Viewing-Sound"></a></h2><p>The following shows a clock, and the squiggly line above the clock shows something that is moving at 3 times during one second.<br>
<img src="../docs/images/Sound3.svg" width="400"></p>
<p>There are programs that can <a href="../docs/Tasks.html#editsound">edit sound</a>.</p>
<p>The "Audacity" program shows the sound as changes during time:<br>
<img src="../docs/sound/laughScreenCast.png"></p>
<p>The line for the sound is the squiggly blue line and is not as smooth as the line near the clock. This means it has a more complicated sound. This is the sound of a baby laugh.</p>
<p>The highlighted area (light blue rectangles) has peaks that are separated and not as fast, which means the tone is lower.</p>
<p>The height (both higher and lower) of the peak means how loud the sound is.</p>
<p>In Audacity, you can experiment with sounds in the "Generate" menu to make a "Chirp" or "Tone".</p>
<p>Select a small part of the sound and use View/Zoom to select to see what form of wave there is. A wave is the ripples as on a lake or the ocean.</p>
<p>One interesting point is that a sine wave is a single frequency, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_wave">square wave</a> is sine waves at all frequencies added together.</p>
