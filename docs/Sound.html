<h2 id="Sound-Frequency">Sound Frequency<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sound-Frequency"></a></h2><p>Sound is made by air being squeezed many times very quickly. It usually gets squeezed by things that vibrate very quickly.</p>
<p></p>
Some examples are:
<ul>
    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips loose.</li>
    <li>Blow through your lips with your lips squeezed tighter like a trumpet player.</li>
    <li>Your voice makes sounds at many different pitches or frequencies.</li>
    <li>Put a rubber band around your fingers and pluck the rubber band.
    Change how tight the rubber band is, and pluck it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When something is vibrating slowly, it makes a low sound, and when vibrating fast, makes a higher sound. When it is slow, it is less frequent, and when fast, it is a higher "frequency".</p><p>When something is tighter, it will usually be a higher frequency.</p><p>Sound is indicated by the number of times it changes per second.
You can hear things as low as about 20 times per second. A voice could
be 300 to 3000 times per second. The highest pitches you can hear are
around 20000 times per second.
